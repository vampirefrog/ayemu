Reusable `.AY` file player. Meant to be compiled with WebAssembly and used on [https://ay.vampi.tech](https://ay.vampi.tech).

I made this project because I found ayplay not reusable.

A similar project is [v68](https://github.com/vampirefrog/v68), which emulates part of a Sharp X68000 and can load music drivers from the command line.

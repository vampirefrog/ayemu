Reusable [`.AY` file](https://vgmrips.net/wiki/AY_File_Format) player. Meant to be compiled with WebAssembly and used on [https://ay.vampi.tech](https://ay.vampi.tech).

I made this project because I could't find a way to reuse [aylet](http://www.svgalib.org/rus/aylet.html#download).

A similar project is [v68](https://github.com/vampirefrog/v68), which emulates part of a Sharp X68000 and can load music drivers from the command line.
